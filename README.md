Semester 1 Project

Introduction to the Scientific Calculator Project
The Scientific Calculator project is designed to provide a robust calculator that can handle not only basic arithmetic operations but also advanced scientific computations. Built using Python and Tkinter, this project introduces GUI (Graphical User Interface) programming, demonstrating how to create interactive applications that are both functional and user-friendly.

This calculator goes beyond typical calculators by incorporating scientific functions like trigonometric calculations (sin, cos, tan), logarithmic functions, exponentiation, and factorials, which are essential in scientific and engineering fields. The project also includes a calculation history feature, allowing users to track past calculations and review previous results.

Project Details
Basic Features:

Performs standard arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Includes decimal point input and handles multiple consecutive operations.
Displays results immediately or upon pressing an "Equals" button.
Scientific Features:

Trigonometric Functions: sin, cos, tan, which calculate the respective values based on the provided input.
Logarithmic Function: Calculates the natural logarithm (base e) of the input.
Square Root and Exponentiation: Finds the square root or raises a number to a specified power.
Factorial Function: Calculates the factorial of an integer input, useful in combinatorics and probability.
Additional Functionalities:

Calculation History: Records each calculation, allowing users to view past results within the application.
Error Handling: Displays error messages for invalid inputs or mathematical errors (e.g., division by zero).
Responsive Layout: The calculator adjusts its button sizes and layout based on the window size, providing a consistent user experience on various screen sizes.
User Interface:

Splash Screen: Displays user details for 4 seconds upon startup, making the project more personalized and engaging.
Responsive and Styled Layout: Features like button colors, equal-sized buttons, padding, and shadow effects enhance the overall aesthetics.
Real-time Interaction: Each button click updates the display, and pressing the "Equals" button evaluates the expression instantly.
This project provides a comprehensive introduction to GUI programming and builds skills in Python, while understanding concepts of user interface design, event handling, and mathematical computation. The scientific calculator is a versatile tool that can be used in daily calculations and scientific work, making it a practical application of programming skills.
